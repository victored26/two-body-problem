# TwoBodyProblem
## Overview
This python project is supposed to be a simple visualization of the two body problem (grativational).
You can select a size (mass) for each body from three options (dropdown), and an eccentricity for the resulting trajectories. 
To calculate the trajectories, the known closed-form solutions, which can be found in any classical mechanics textbook (such as Landau & Lifshitz), were used. 

## Install Dependencies
Run `python pip install tk` to download tkinter to be able to run the app.

## Run
Run `python two_body_problem.py` to run the app.
