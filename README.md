# Two Body Problem
## Overview
This python project is supposed to be a simple visualization of the two body problem (grativational).
You can select a size (mass) for each body from three options (dropdown), and an eccentricity for the resulting trajectories. 
To calculate the trajectories, the known closed-form solutions, which can be found in any classical mechanics textbook (such as Landau & Lifshitz), were used. 

## Install Dependencies
